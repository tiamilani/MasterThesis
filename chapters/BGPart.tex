\begin{itemize}
    \item BGP de facto standard on the internet
    \item What is an AS
    \item interconnection between ASes
\end{itemize}

\section{BGP}
\label{sec:bgp_intro}

\begin{itemize}
    \item High level of BGP
    \item BGP messages
    \item BGP Update messages
    \item BGP policies
	\item two type of BGP noise, the one caused by BGP itself and the one 
		caused by flapping interfaces
\end{itemize}

\section{BGP MRAI}
\label{sec:bgp_mrai}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is MRAI?
	\item Rember that the MRAI purpose is to avoid the BGP noise
    \item Previous works on MRAI
    \item Suppositions on the MRAI influence

\section{BGP RFD}
\label{sec:bgp_rfd}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is RFD?
	\item Remember that RFD purpose is to avoid the noise produced
		by route flapping
	\item RFD cant distinguish the noise, is to restrictive, R bush point to
		avoid the use of RFD for the first noise increasing the threshold.
    \item Why is used RFD?
    \item Evolution of RFD?
    \item RFD Today
\end{itemize}
