%\fxfatal{Expand the concepts}

What we call the Internet is a single network that interconnects more than \num{60000}
\acp{AS} that share their knowledge to spread the sub-nets reachability.
An \ac{AS} is a single entity that holds and controls some \textit{IP} prefixes
used by one or more operators.
Every \ac{AS} is responsible for its own inter-connectivity policies that control
the spread of information obtained by the outside and the one from the inside.

The \ac{BGP} is the only protocol used on the Internet that controls the propagation
of the knowledge between different \acp{AS}.
\ac{BGP} has been released in \num{1989} and is in use on the internet since
\num{1994}.
Since that year \ac{BGP} is growth a lot, it reached its last version, number
fourth, in \num{2006} \cite{rfc4271}.
Up to now, \ac{BGP} can be expanded with tens of \acp{RFC} that extends the
range of possibilities,
from policies to attributes used to tag messages and give more information than
just the path to reach the destination.

Multiple of its parameters play a central role in it, and the correct setting
of them could influence the performances of, not only the single \ac{AS} but
the entire network.
For this reason, the research is still active to find new technologies and
a trade-off between, convergence time and messages transmitted.

In this thesis, more precisely in \Cref{cha:bgp_art}, I'm going to introduce
two of them, \ac{MRAI}, used to compress multiple input messages into one
output message and the \ac{RFD} parameter, that is used to penalize unstable paths
suppressing routes.
Those two parameters goal is to control two different types of noise that
\ac{BGP} creates/suffers.

The existence of those two parameters has been studied separately many different
times \cite{fabrikant2011there,daggitt2018rate,qiu2005optimal,gray2020bgp}.
But, there are almost no studies on the correlation of those parameters.
Even if the effects of one interact with the other.

\section{Internet today}
\label{sec:internet_today}

Internet, as a network, is constantly growing, in terms of \acp{AS}, prefixes
and messages transmitted.
Increasing also the load on the \ac{BGP} nodes and by consequence the load
of the network in general.
There are constantly smaller prefixes announced, the number of $/24$ prefixes
distributed in the last years has been growing constantly.
Data obtained from the annual report of the \ac{AS} 131072 that register the
evolution of its node since \num{2007} from two \ac{BGP}
speakers point of the \ac{APNIC}, one located in Japan and the other in
Australia\footnote{\href{https://blog.apnic.net/2021/01/05/bgp-in-2020-the-bgp-table/}{source APNIC data}}.

This growth of the Internet is not negligible because of one, between the may,
problem that it has due to the \ac{BGP} protocol.
\ac{BGP} suffers from the \textit{Path Exploration} problem, a node can enter in
a transitory state where it continuously shares non-optimal paths while it
doesn't reach a stable state.
Even few tens of nodes can generate thousands of messages due to this problem
\cite{deshpande2004impact}.
And this problem cannot be overloked on a \num{60000} nodes network that we all
rely on every day.

\section{Correlation between variables and convergence}
\label{sec:bgp_correlations}

The two parameters that will be studied in this thesis are \ac{MRAI} and \ac{RFD}
and how the interaction between them works.
Our first hypothesis is that, indeed, there is an interaction.
This hypothesis is sustained by the fact that both parameters operate to
control the noise of \ac{BGP}, with different parameters and different behaviour,
but, if a node wants to transmit a message it must respect \ac{MRAI} and the input
could be caused by \ac{RFD} that suppress/reintroduce a route.
On the opposite case, a too small \ac{MRAI} value could permit different message
storms that would trigger the \ac{RFD} suppression systems creating vicious circle.

One of the goals of reducing the value of \ac{MRAI} is to reach a faster convergence
paying the cost of more messages.
Unfortunately, looking only to \ac{MRAI} is not possible to get reliable results
for general purposes, in-fact, like showed in \Cref{cha:bgp_rfd}, is possible
to obtain the opposite result due to the fact that to solve \ac{RFD} suppression
is required a longer time.

On the opposite case if we tune in the wrong way \ac{RFD} we would end up to
be too much permissive, leaving to handle all the noise to \ac{MRAI} that could
be not effective if the storms are sufficiently delayed in time.

For those reasons is important to study these two parameters together, because
there could be a strong co-dependence.

\section{The goal of this thesis}
\label{sec:thesis_goal}

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Why is important understand this correlation?
%\end{itemize}

The goal of this thesis is to prove that the noise detectors of the \ac{BGP}
protocol are correlated, studying this correlation through stimulative experiments
and from those give useful hints on how those two parameters interact with one another.
In order to build the basis for future experiments that can study more deeply
and maybe in a formal way the phenomena.
Is also mandatory for this thesis to develop the platform where those experiments
would be executed and make that platform public
available\footnote{\href{https://github.com/tiamilani/BGPFSM}{GitHub repository}}.

In \Cref{cha:bgp_art} are going to be presented the protocol and more deeply
the two parameters studied, while in \Cref{cha:des} I'm going to present
the structure of the platform that will be used in \Cref{cha:bgp_fsm,cha:bgp_mrai_experiments,cha:bgp_rfd}
to perform the experiments about the \textit{Path Exploration} problem and then
how \ac{MRAI} and \ac{RFD} can impact the performances, conclusions to follow
in \Cref{cha:conclusion}.

The \ac{BGP} community has not yet reached a common agreement on what values
to use for this reason I will evaluate different possible techniques that can
be applied to both the parameters and comment on the network performances obtained.
