\section{Correlation between variables and convergence}
\label{sec:bgp_correlations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Expose the hypothesis of the correlation
\end{itemize}

Forget about the possibility to converge in seconds or even sub-seconds
when we talk about internet routing convergence there are a lot of factors
that influence it.
The convergence time is mostly affected by some timers that rules the Internet.
It could require up to different minutes to achieve a complete convergence, 
spread a new routing information to all the nodes.

One of the most effective timers is \ac{MRAI} and it has been already
proven \fxfatal{Insert citation} that whith
