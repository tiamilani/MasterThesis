\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cha:conclusion}

In this thesis I exposed different noise problems that \ac{BGP} cotainse and
studied the parameters that are used to curb the problem.
I have then anayzed the results from thousends of experimentes in order to 
provide a solid baseline that shows how \ac{MRAI} and \ac{RFD} are related
one another.
I have also showed that, due to the \textit{Path exploration} problem, even 
in small networks is really difficult to infer the causes behind a transmitted
signal.

The instruments developed during this thesis are pubblically available in the
hope that other scientist could use them to study properties of \ac{BGP} that
is extreamly vast.

I have then analyzed how new techniques differ from the standard or legacy one,
like in the case of \ac{RFD} where the legacy values are still present on the
internet and can have a huge impact on the convergence.
Also the impact that can have in terms of performances \ac{MRAI} on \ac{RFD}
how after a certain threshold the gain obtained from the lower number of 
suppressions is ininfluent in terms of convergence time and messages transmitted.

This thesis creates the basis for studies on the correlation of \ac{BGP} parameters
and would also be a warning for those studies that points to improve only 
one aspect of \ac{BGP}.
Remember to always look from different prospective because what looks like an
improvement on the one hand could bring the overall performance of the 
network to collapse.

\section{Future Works}
\label{sec:future_works}

The development of the platform to increment the number of features is one of 
the major points in the future works, but during the experiments we have also
made some assumptions/restrictions to the environment.
Those restrictions could be relaxed to study more etherogeneous environments.

\subsubsection{Policies}

One of the first assumption is that every node accept everything comes from its
neighbours and redistribute it.
This is not always true, \acp{AS} on the internet can have any sort of policy, 
checking any possible attribute of the message received.
A possible future work could be to study the bibliography behind those policies
in order to be able to implement it and study again the performances of 
the network with those restrictions.

\subsubsection{Multiple destinations and path aggregation}

During the experiments I never had more than one destination that transmit a 
signal, even if the \ac{DES} permits to have multiple of them.
Obviously more destinations could produce more messages and more \ac{ADV}
storms, but a possible interesting point could see the reactions of the nodes
with the path aggregation activated and how it can impact the performances.
